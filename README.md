This is a study of the listings of the book <b>"Object Design Style Guide"</b> by M.Noback.

As the title suggests, the book contains very useful and very clear guidelines on how 
to structure modern web applications using an object oriented programming (OOP) approach. 

The author states on page 254: "The programming language used for the code samples in this book is a generalized
object-oriented programming language. Its syntax is a mix of PHP and Java."

I decided to rewrite every code listing in each of the 10 chapters in the book to:

(1) practice 

(2) make sure the code syntax is 100 % consistent with PHP version 7.1 at least.

I added remarks and observations above the code to make it completely intelligible.
